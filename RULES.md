RPG Battle Card Game — Rules (canonical)

Components, Setup & How To Play

Character Cards

These characters will be your champions in battle. Their **STR** determines how powerful their attacks are, while their **MAG** determines how powerful their healing spells.

To begin setting up the game, take turns drafting each of these characters. For 2-player games, each player should draft 3 characters. For 3-player games, draft 2 each, and for 4 or more players, choose 1 each. Start each character at their maximum HP by placing a marker on that cell on their card. If they would drop below 1 HP during battle, tilt their card sideways to signify that they cannot take action and cannot be healed except via the Revive action.

Character list:

| Name   | HP  | STR | MAG |
| :----: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Vex    | 13  | 4   | 4   |
| Kalen  | 17  | 3   | 3   |
| Anya   | 23  | 2   | 2   |
| Sera   | 30  | 1   | 1   |
| Gideon | 17  | 4   | 2   |
| Mystra | 17  | 2   | 4   |
| Sybil  | 23  | 1   | 3   |
| Thorne | 23  | 3   | 1   |

Winning & Losing

When a character would drop below 1 HP, they are considered to have been knocked out, or KO’d. While there is a way to revive them, they cannot be healed with normal healing spells, and if all of a player’s characters are KO’d, they are out of the game. The winner is the last player with at least one character still active.

On Your Turn

For each of your active characters, from left to right, you may have them take one action by playing a card from your hand (other than a Quick Action card, which you may use during other people’s turns). After you have exhausted your actions, you may draw back up to a 5-card hand, or draw 1. This ends your turn and it passes to the next player.

Action Cards

These 100 cards comprise the possible actions your characters may take during battle. Once all players have completed their character draft, shuffle these and deal 5 cards to each player, then place the rest of the cards facedown as the draw deck, with space next to it for a discard pile.
